# Know Your Crochet Yarn
This is a small project that will solve basic counting of yarn needed for project

## How will it work?
1. you upload an PDF file -> decoded using .py libraries
2. you select your hook size and yarn weight
3. the program will calculate how many yarn you'll need for your project

This will be mine first python project but I've coded in C, C# and Java before

<b> Any recomendations and remidenders are welcomed! </b>
